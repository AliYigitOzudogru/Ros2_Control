feat: PS4 controller integration and rover control implementation

🎮 PS4 Controller Integration:
- Implemented ps4_rover_controller node for joystick input processing
- R2 trigger (axes[4]) mapped to forward/backward motion with power scaling (gas = pow(r2, 0.7))
- Left analog stick (axes[0]) mapped to steering control
- Added comprehensive debug logging with 4 decimal precision
- Fixed topic remapping: PS4 controller publishes to /cmd_vel

🔧 Controller Configuration:
- Fixed diff_drive_controller parameters:
  * wheel_separation: 0.5 → 1.1 (correct rover width)
  * wheel_radius: 0.1 → 0.2 (correct wheel radius)
  * wheels_per_side: 1 → 2 (4-wheel configuration)
- Corrected wheel joint names in controllers.yaml
- Both joint_state_broadcaster and diff_drive_controller active

⚡ Speed Optimization:
- Increased max_linear_speed from 2.0 to 50.0 m/s (for testing)
- Increased max_angular_speed from 2.0 to 10.0 rad/s
- Added power scaling to amplify small R2 trigger inputs
- Launch file parameters now override code defaults correctly

🌊 Physics Parameters:
- Added friction to all 4 wheels in aero.ignition.xacro:
  * mu=2.0, mu2=2.0 (lateral/longitudinal friction)
  * kp=10000000.0, kd=1.0 (contact stiffness/damping)
  * min_depth=0.005 (contact threshold)

✅ Verified Working:
- PS4 controller connected and publishing joy messages
- Velocity commands successfully published to /cmd_vel (50 m/s linear confirmed)
- Controller manager active with both controllers loaded
- Joint state broadcaster publishing joint states
- gz_ros2_control plugin loaded and running

❌ Outstanding Issue:
- Rover not physically moving in Gazebo simulation despite correct command transmission
- Wheels not rotating visually
- Joint velocities remain zero in /joint_states topic

🔍 Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. Verify wheel joints are type="continuous" not "fixed" in URDF
2. Check ros2_control hardware interface has all 4 wheel joints with velocity command interface
3. Inspect Gazebo collision geometry (wheels touching ground?)
4. Monitor joint_states for velocity changes during R2 trigger press
5. Test manual diff_drive commands to isolate hardware interface issue

📝 Documentation:
- Added comprehensive WORK_LOG.md with full debugging history
- Documented all attempted solutions and their results
- Created checklist for tomorrow's debugging session

Files Modified:
- src/aero_arm_control/aero_arm_control/ps4_rover_controller.py
- src/aero_bringup/launch/aero_ignition.launch.py
- src/aero_bringup/launch/aero.launch.py
- src/aero_bringup/config/controllers.yaml
- src/aero_description/urdf/aero.ignition.xacro
- WORK_LOG.md (new)

Testing:
- PS4 R2 trigger: 0.0 → 1.0 range verified
- Command velocity: Linear up to 50 m/s successfully transmitted
- Topic echo confirms correct message publication
- Controller status: Both controllers active and running

---

This commit represents a complete PS4 controller integration with proper velocity
mapping and debugging infrastructure. The software stack is 90% complete - only
the physical motion (likely a joint definition or hardware interface issue)
remains to be resolved.

Tested on: ROS2 Humble, Ignition Gazebo Fortress, gz_ros2_control 0.7.17
